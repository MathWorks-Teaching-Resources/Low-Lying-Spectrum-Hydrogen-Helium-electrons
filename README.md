# Low-Lying-Spectrum-Hydrogen-Helium-electrons
Live Script shows how to solve Hydrogen and Helium atom low-laying spectrum numerically. The final section is dedicated to constructing many-body wavefucntion obeying Pauli principle for 3 interacting electrons, first with, and then, without decomposing three-body coordinate wavefunctions into the product of single-particle orbitals.
